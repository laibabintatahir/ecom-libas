        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
          "Libaslegrace" is a fusion of modest clothing (libas) with an element
          of grace and elegance. Established in 2024, our brand emerged from the
          collective struggle of many Muslim women seeking to embrace modesty
          without compromising on elegance. "Verily, Allah is beautiful and He
          loves beauty," we understand that modesty is the crown of a Muslim
          woman. Libaslegrace is dedicated to illuminating Allah's message and
          spreading positivity through the art of modest dressing.
          <h2>Our Mission</h2>
          <p>
            Our mission at Libaslegrace is to create a world where every woman
            feels comfortable and confident. We aim to inspire women to embrace
            modest wear as a source of empowerment and self-expression. Through
            our carefully curated collections, we provide a wardrobe that aligns
            with the values of modesty while offering chic and stylish options
            for every occasion.
